/** GetNewAddress: returns a new coin address for receiving payments.
  * If an account is specified, payments received with the address will be credited to that account.
  *
  * Parameter #1 : Account (String, Optional)
  *   The name of the account to put the address in.
  *   The default is the default account, an empty string (“”)
  *
  * Result: (String;base58)
  *   A P2PKH address which has not previously been returned by this RPC.
  *   The address will be marked as a receiving address in the wallet.
  *
  *   The address may already have been part of the keypool,
  *   so other RPCs such as the dumpwallet RPC may have disclosed it previously.
  *
  *   If the wallet is unlocked, its keypool will also be filled to its max (by default, 100 unused keys).
  *   If the wallet is locked and its keypool is empty, this RPC will fail.
